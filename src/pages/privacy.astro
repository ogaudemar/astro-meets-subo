							<div class="content-text"><p>ClearSwell LLC ("Company," "we," "us"), located at 1155 N Cedar St, Glendale CA 91207, United States, operates Subo the Survey Bot and associated websites and services ("Service"). This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have. It applies to Discord server owners and authorized creators who manage surveys, and to participants who respond to them.</p>

							<div class="content-text"><p>The data relationship differs by role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creators</strong> (server owners and admins): access Subo via Discord commands and the web admin. For survey results and response data collected on their behalf, Subo acts as a <strong>data processor</strong> and creators are the <strong>data controllers</strong>. Creators are responsible for the lawful collection of their community members' survey responses.</li>
<li><strong>Participants</strong> (survey respondents): respond to surveys invited by creators. For profile data, XP, and participation history, Subo acts as the <strong>data controller</strong>. For response content collected on behalf of a creator, Subo acts as a <strong>data processor</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a participant and have questions about how a specific survey handles your data, please contact the server admin who ran the survey.</p>

							</div>
						</h3>
						<div class="content_box">
							<div class="content-text"><p>We are the controller and responsible for your data. Here is the Personal Data we collect:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile Data</strong>: by accessing and using the Service, we will receive from Discord your Discord ID, username, and the name and identifier of the Discord server you come from. This information will be associated with a unique identifier that we generate for you. You may also be asked to provide Personal Data such as your email address, age, gender, language or location.</li>
<li><strong>Survey data</strong>: when you create a questionnaire on our platform, we collect the content of the questionnaire and its attributes. We also collect metadata such as the date and time of creation.</li>
<li><strong>Respondent Data</strong>: when you participate and answer questions from our surveys, we will also collect your answers such as personal opinions on the topic of the research (products and services, brands and companies), declared behaviors, demographic information (including marital status, family details, occupation, education, media usage, income bracket, home ownership). In some cases, you may be asked to voluntarily provide Personal Data which may be considered "sensitive", including racial and ethnic origin, political and religious beliefs, sexual orientation and health or disability status. You may refuse to answer these or any other questions or discontinue participation at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Web Survey Data</strong>: if you respond to a survey through the web interface rather than Discord, we may collect additional technical data including your IP address, browser type, device type, and session identifiers for access control, fraud prevention, and service operation.</li>

						<h3 class="def-18_72 title-text--inner text--08__heading">Survey Anonymity Modes
							<div class="text--08__icon">
							</div>
						</h3>
						<div class="content_box">
							<div class="content-text"><p>The anonymity mode for each survey is set by the creator. There are three modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparent</strong>: individual votes and responses are shared with the survey creator and made visible to the community (other server members). Both the creator and other participants can see who answered what.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-private</strong>: individual votes and responses are shared with the survey creator only, and are not made public to the community.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous (Full Anonymous)</strong>: no identity link is created or retained at any point — Subo cannot attribute the response to any specific user. Because no identity link exists, anonymous responses cannot be deleted via <code>/profile</code> or by individual request. Anonymous responses may still be sent to OpenAI for text summarization; no identity information is included in those requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants should contact the server admin if uncertain about how a specific survey handles their data, as the anonymity mode is determined by the creator.</p>

						<h3 class="def-18_72 title-text--inner text--08__heading">How We Use Your Personal Data
							<div class="text--08__icon">
							</div>
						</h3>
						<div class="content_box">
							<div class="content-text"><p>We use the data you share with us to give you a good experience and to provide information and insights to our research clients.</p>
<p>We use Personal Data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide anonymized data to our clients: we will generally provide data sets in an aggregated form, such as reports showing the total number and percentage of respondents having given a certain answer to a question. In some cases, we may share topline results with the press or on our own website and social media.</li>
<li>Provide our clients with entire or partial non-aggregated data sets which do not reveal your identity. For example, text answers to open-ended questions will generally be anonymized, then transferred in full.</li>
<li>Verify your identity and prevent fraudulent activity: we may use a combination of questions, location data, IP address and digital fingerprinting techniques to identify participants we do not want to access certain surveys.</li>
<li>Manage your account (if you contact us, we can associate your user identifier to your account details to better support you).</li>
<li>Communicate with you regarding your participation in the program.</li>
<li>Establish a leaderboard ranking different users for the servers you belong to. XP tracking requires persistent participation history; monthly leaderboard scores reset but the underlying history is retained. Role reward eligibility requires storing qualifying actions permanently.</li>
<li>Recurring and scheduled surveys: automated delivery on creator-configured schedules. Participation remains voluntary. Response data is handled identically to single-instance surveys.</li>
<li>Creator Network: as part of our own market research, we may contact Subo survey creators (server owners) to invite them to participate in surveys conducted by Subo/ClearSwell. This uses contact information (Discord username, server association) already held as part of your creator account. You may opt out at any time by contacting hello@subo.ai.</li>
<li>Service providers: we may work with trusted service providers to help us run our business, for example cloud data storage, survey/data collection technology, validation and anti-fraud services.</li>
<li>OpenAI API: we use the OpenAI API to (1) analyze and summarize open-ended text responses, (2) generate survey drafts via the <code>/draft</code> command, and (3) process Full Anonymous survey responses where no identity data is included. The OpenAI API will not use the data to train or improve its models, but will retain the data for abuse and misuse monitoring purposes for a maximum of 30 days. You can learn more about <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies" target="_blank">how the OpenAI API uses your data in its privacy policy</a>.</li>
<li>Payment processing (Stripe): subscription payments are processed by Stripe, Inc. Subo does not store full payment card details. We receive subscription status (tier, renewal date, server association) from Stripe. <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">Stripe's privacy policy</a> applies to payment data.</li>
<li>We may also provide links to third-party bots, websites and apps, which are independent from Subo and have their own separate privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third-party websites or apps. We recommend that you carefully read the privacy policies of each site or app.</li>
<li>In rare instances, we may be required by law to share Personal Data with public authorities, or we may share data to defend our rights, including with legal advisors.</li>
<li>If our business gets acquired, merges, or in case of bankruptcy, your data will be considered an asset and may be transferred to the acquirer. In this case, we will require the other party to agree in writing to respect this Privacy Policy.</li>
