								<div class="content-text "><p>These Terms of Service ("<strong>Terms</strong>", "<strong>Terms of Service</strong>") govern your use of our web pages located at https://subo.ai and our Discord bot Subo The Survey Bot (together or individually "<strong>Service</strong>") operated by ClearSwell LLC ("<strong>Company</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>"), a US company seated at 1155 N Cedar St, Glendale, CA 91207, USA.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect, safeguard and disclose information that results from your use of our web pages. Please read it here <a href="/privacy">https://subo.ai/privacy</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms, our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, and our <a href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</a> ("<strong>Agreements</strong>"). You acknowledge that you have read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound of them.</p>

								<div class="text--08__icon">











								</div>
							</h3>
							<div class="content_box ">
								<div class="content-text "><p>We operate an online survey and poll platform, through which Discord server owners and the server members they authorize ("<strong>creators</strong>") can conduct surveys and polls among members of their server. Creators create a survey questionnaire and set targeting criteria. We distribute the survey to the members who meet the targeting criteria ("<strong>participants</strong>"), collect survey answers from participants, and provide reports to creators, which contain the creator's survey questions and the answers to such questions ("<strong>survey report</strong>").</p>
<p>In addition to traditional multiple-choice and open-ended surveys, the Service offers a conversational survey format powered by AI, which guides participants through questions in a chat-like experience. Creators may also use the web admin dashboard at https://subo.ai to create and manage surveys, view results, and configure their settings.</p>
<p>The Service includes poll functionality, allowing creators to run quick single-question polls within their Discord server. It also includes gamification features, such as XP points, leaderboards, and role assignments awarded to participants based on their engagement.</p>
<p>Survey creators may configure one of three anonymity modes for each survey: <strong>Transparent</strong> (responses are attributed to the participant), <strong>Semi-private</strong> (the creator can see who responded but not which answer belongs to whom), or <strong>Fully Anonymous</strong> (responses cannot be attributed to any individual, and individual responses cannot be deleted). The anonymity mode is set by the creator at survey creation and cannot be changed after responses are collected. Participants should review the anonymity setting before responding.</p>
