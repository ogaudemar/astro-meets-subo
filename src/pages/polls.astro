  <h1>Advanced Discord polls with Subo</h2>
  <h2 class="subtitle">Yes, Discord has native polls... but theyâ€™re limited.</h2>
<p>With Subo, you get powerful controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose who can vote</li>
<li>Set when polls start and close</li>
<li>Export the data</li>
<li>Decide how results are shown</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>Polls are perfect for group decisions, quick takes, or keeping members engaged.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">ðŸ§  Build a Clearer Picture Over Time</h2>
<p>When you want to collect more information about your community, one strategy is to create a survey convo with multiple questions. </p>
<p>Another strategy is to run multiple quick polls (or short surveys) regularly.</p>
<p> With Subo, all responses are tied to each member (unless anonymous mode is on), so you can connect the dots over time.</p>
<p>See how opinions evolve. Follow up. Understand individual preferences, not just overall votes.</p>
<p>Discordâ€™s native polls canâ€™t do that.</p>
