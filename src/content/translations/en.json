    {
      "question": "Why do I need to choose between Stripe and Discord?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why do I have to wait for my premium subscription to become active?",
      "answer": "Stripe collects your email address to create an account for you, but we can't connect this email address with your Discord server. This means we need to manually verify your account before activating your premium subscription. We intend to automate this process in the future, but for now, we appreciate your patience."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I find my server ID?",
      "answer": "You can find your server ID by right-clicking on your server name in Discord and selecting 'Copy Server ID'. If you don't see this option, you may need to enable Developer Mode in your Discord settings (which we recommend anyway)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I change or cancel a subscription?",
      "answer": "You can manage your subscription at any time via the Stripe Billing Portal or Discord Store, depending on how you upgraded. To access the Stripe Billing Portal, you will need to log in with the email address you used to pay for the upgrade. See links in footer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I cancel my premium subscription?",
      "answer": "Once the end of your subscription period (month, year) comes, your bot will be switched back to the free version of Subo. You will still be able to use Subo, but with the limitations of the free tier.  If you have a project live, it may stop if you reach your maximum allowance for respondents or responses. If you have too many projects on your account, you may have to delete some before you are allowed to create new ones."

  "storyBody": [
    "Subo was started in 2021 by a small team of pros 🤓 with decades of experience building survey platforms used by millions of global users — and by the world's top brands and researchers. We'd seen from the inside how survey tools were built: optimized for enterprise sales cycles, not for the people actually taking them. The experience was consistently bad, and we wanted to do something about it.",
    "So we built Subo. Bootstrapped, self-funded, and fiercely independent — entirely focused on making feedback feel like a conversation rather than a chore. Discord was the perfect place to start: a platform where communities were already talking, and where the tools for listening were badly missing.",
    "Since launch, Subo has grown to serve over <strong>15,000 Discord servers</strong> — from gaming guilds to creator communities, DAOs, sports clubs, brand communities, and educational groups. We're a small team, and we intend to stay that way."

      "question": "What happens if I cancel my premium subscription?",
      "answer": "Once the end of your subscription period (month, year) comes, your bot will be switched back to the free version of Subo. You will still be able to use Subo, but with the limitations of the free tier.  If you have a project live, it may stop if you reach your maximum allowance for respondents or responses. If you have too many projects on your account, you may have to delete some before you are allowed to create new ones."

    {
      "question": "How do I change or cancel a subscription?",
      "answer": "You can manage your subscription on the Stripe Billing Portal if you upgraded with Stripe. If you upgraded with Discord, go to your user settings in Discord to manage your subscriptions."
