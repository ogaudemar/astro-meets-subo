    {
      "question": "Why do I need to choose between Stripe and Discord?",
      "answer": "We support Discord's native App Store, which is more convenient for many users, but the Discord App Store doesn't offer multiple server and annual subscriptions, so we also created a Stripe solution for that."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do I have to wait for my premium subscription to become active?",
      "answer": "Stripe collects your email address to create an account for you, but we can't connect this email address with your Discord server. This means we need to manually verify your account before activating your premium subscription. We intend to automate this process in the future, but for now, we appreciate your patience."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I find my server ID?",
      "answer": "You can find your server ID by right-clicking on your server name in Discord and selecting 'Copy Server ID'. If you don't see this option, you may need to enable Developer Mode in your Discord settings (which we recommend anyway)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I change or cancel a subscription?",
      "answer": "You can manage your subscription at any time via the Stripe Billing Portal or Discord Store, depending on how you upgraded. To access the Stripe Billing Portal, you will need to log in with the email address you used to pay for the upgrade. See links in footer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I cancel my premium subscription?",
      "answer": "Once the end of your subscription period (month, year) comes, your bot will be switched back to the free version of Subo. You will still be able to use Subo, but with the limitations of the free tier.  If you have a project live, it may stop if you reach your maximum allowance for respondents or responses. If you have too many projects on your account, you may have to delete some before you are allowed to create new ones."

      "question": "Why do I need to choose between Stripe and Discord?",
      "answer": "We support Discord's native App Store, which is more convenient to many users, but Discord doesn't support multiple server and annual subscriptions, so we also created a Stripe solution for that."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I cancel my premium subscription?",
      "answer": "Once the end of your subscription period (month, year) comes, your bot will be switched back to the free version of Subo. You will still be able to use Subo, but with the limitations of the free tier.  If you have a project live, it may stop if you reach your maximum allowance for respondents or responses. If you have too many projects on your account, you may have to delete some before you are allowed to create new ones."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I change or cancel a subscription?",
      "answer": "You can manage your subscription on the Stripe Billing Portal if you upgraded with Stripe. If you upgraded with Discord, go to your user settings in Discord to manage your subscriptions."
