# How to Gamify Your Discord Community with XP, Leaderboards, and Role Rewards

Getting members to answer polls and surveys is one of the perennial challenges of community management. You can ask nicely, remind them twice, and still end up with a 5% response rate from a server full of engaged, active members.

The problem isn't apathy. It's incentive. Members will happily spend hours on your server chatting and gaming — but clicking a survey link feels like work. The solution isn't just to make surveys shorter (though that helps). It's to make participation itself rewarding.

That's what Subo's gamification system does.

## Subo's Three Layers of Gamification

Subo has three distinct mechanisms for rewarding members who participate in surveys and polls:

### 1. XP Points

Every time a member completes a survey or poll, they earn XP (experience points). You can:

- **Customize the XP name** — call it "Coins", "Stars", "Gold", "Reputation", or whatever fits your community's theme
- **Set custom XP values** per survey — weight important surveys more heavily
- **Track cumulative XP** over time — members build up their score with every participation

XP is always visible, which creates a visible, running score that motivates continued participation.

### 2. Role Rewards Based on Overall XP

As members accumulate XP, they can automatically unlock Discord roles at set thresholds. You configure up to 5 role milestones:

- 100 XP → "Participant" role
- 500 XP → "Regular" role
- 1,000 XP → "Veteran" role
- 5,000 XP → "Elite" role
- 10,000 XP → "Legend" role

These thresholds and role names are entirely up to you. The system handles the role assignment automatically.

This mechanic is particularly powerful because:
- Roles are visible in the member list and in chat
- Higher roles can unlock channels, perks, and other server privileges
- The progression feels meaningful — members aren't just completing a survey, they're leveling up

### 3. Leaderboards

Leaderboards add a competitive layer: they aknowledge your active members, "shame" unresponsive ones.

Standard Leaderboards show total XP since "Forever". Monthly XP leaderboards reset every month. 

- Members can see who's at the top of the participation rankings
- Monthly resets mean newcomers can compete — it's not dominated forever by early adopters
- You can offer special role rewards (e.g., "Top Contributor of the Month") for monthly leaderboard leaders

The leaderboard is shareable with the rest of the community — members can use the /leaderboard command to see their rank, or you can post it in a channel to celebrate your most active community members.

Standard Leaderboards are available on all plans, Monthly Leaderboards are for Premium and above plans.

### 4. Per-Survey Role Rewards (Premium)

Beyond the XP system, Subo lets you attach a specific role reward to any individual survey or poll. Complete this particular survey → get this particular role.

This is useful for:
- **Event-based rewards** — "Complete the event feedback survey to get the Event Participant role"
- **Milestone surveys** — "Finish the onboarding survey to unlock the Verified Member role"
- **Exclusive access** — "Complete the beta tester survey to get the Beta Tester role and access to our #beta channel"

## Setting Up XP in Your Server

Here's how to get the XP system running:

### Basic Setup

1. Invite Subo to your server if you haven't already
2. Use `/xp_settings` on Discord or go to Settings in the web app to enable the XP system
3. Set your XP name (Premium and above)
4. Configure role milestones (achievements) 

### Customizing XP Values

By default, all polls and surveys award the same amount of XP per questions. 

Premium plans can set different XP values per polls and per survey question. Bonus completion is the percentage (0% to 100%) which respondents obtain after answering the entire survey. A 0% bonus means there is no bonus for people who complete the entire survey. A 100% bonus means that only respondents who complete the entire survey get an XP reward, participants who abandon during completion get nothing.

### Running Monthly Competitions

1. Enable the monthly leaderboard in your Subo configuration
2. Announce it in your server at the start of each month: "XP resets on the 1st — compete for the Top Contributor role!"
3. Post the leaderboard mid-month to remind members where they stand
4. Award the winner role at the end of the month, then reset for the next cycle

## Real-World Gamification Examples

### Gaming Community: Raid Team Feedback

A guild running weekly raids uses Subo to collect post-raid feedback. Each completed survey earns 50 "Guild Points" (their custom XP name). After 500 Guild Points, members unlock the "Veteran Raider" role with exclusive access to the #officer-chat channel. Monthly top contributors get "MVP" for the month.

Result: Raid feedback completion jumped from under 20% to over 70%.

### Creator Server: Fan Engagement

A content creator uses Subo polls and surveys to let fans vote on upcoming content. Every poll response earns "Creator Coins" (XP). At 200 coins, fans unlock the "Super Fan" role with early access to new videos. The top 3 earners each month get a special "Featured Fan" role.

Result: Poll engagement increased significantly, and the leaderboard became a community talking point.

### Educational Server: Study Group Tracking

A tutoring community uses comprehension check surveys after every learning session. Each completed check earns "Study Points." Milestone roles mark progress: "Beginner," "Intermediate," "Advanced," "Scholar." The monthly leaderboard shows the most diligent students.

Result: Members actively reminded each other to complete comprehension checks to stay competitive.

## Why Gamification Works

Gamification isn't about manipulation — it's about making the value exchange explicit. And value doesn't need to be monetary. Participation has always been valuable for the community manager (they get data), but it used to be invisible for the member. Gamification makes the value visible:

- **Points** = visible proof of contribution
- **Roles** = status and access that reflect investment
- **Leaderboards** = recognition and friendly competition

When members can see their ranking and know that consistent participation leads to tangible status in the community, participation becomes part of community identity rather than an interruption.

## Getting Started

The XP system is available on all plans (including free). Custom XP names, values, and role rewards for monthly XP require Premium or above. Per-survey role rewards require Premium or above.
