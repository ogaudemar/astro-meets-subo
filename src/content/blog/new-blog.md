Here is a sample of some basic Markdown syntax that can be used when writing Markdown content in Astro.

## Headings

The following HTML `<h1>`—`<h6>` elements represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level while `<h6>` is the lowest.

# H1

## H2

### H3

#### H4

##### H5

###### H6

## Paragraph


## Images

### Syntax

```markdown
![Alt text](./full/or/relative/path/of/image)
```

### Output

## Blockquotes

The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a `footer` or `cite` element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.

### Blockquote without attribution

#### Syntax

```markdown
> Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae.  
> **Note** that you can use _Markdown syntax_ within a blockquote.
```

> **Note** that you can use _Markdown syntax_ within a blockquote.

### Blockquote with attribution

#### Syntax

```markdown
> Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.<br>
> — <cite>Rob Pike[^1]</cite>
```

#### Output
