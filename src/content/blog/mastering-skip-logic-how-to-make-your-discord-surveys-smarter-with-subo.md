# Mastering Skip Logic: How to Make Your Discord Surveys Smarter with Subo

Surveys are a powerful way to gather insights from your community in Discord, but let's be real—no one enjoys answering irrelevant questions. That's where skip logic comes in. By dynamically adjusting survey paths based on a respondent's answers, you can keep your surveys short, relevant, and engaging.

Skip logic can help you gather the right insights without overwhelming your audience. Let's dive into how it works and when to use it.

## 🌱 What is Skip Logic?

Skip logic (also called branching logic) lets you hide or skip different questions from respondents based on their previous answers. Instead of forcing every participant through the same list of questions, you can create personalized paths that make your surveys feel more interactive and efficient.

## 🎯 When Should You Use Skip Logic?

Here are some key situations where skip logic makes your surveys smarter:

### 1️⃣ Segmenting Your Audience

Not all respondents are the same. Skip logic helps you tailor your questions to different groups based on their interests, experience, or preferences.

🔹 **Example 1**: a Game Studio can ask players what platform they use (PC, Console, Mobile). If respondents choose "PC," you can ask them about hardware specs, while console players can get questions about their favorite exclusives.

🔹 **Example 2**: As a creator, you can ask the community if they follow you on YouTube, Twitch, or TikTok. Depending on their answer, show questions about their content preferences on that platform.

### 2️⃣ Skipping Irrelevant Questions

No one likes answering questions that don't apply to them. Skip logic ensures respondents only see relevant questions, keeping surveys shorter and engagement higher.

🔹 **Example 1**: If a player says they haven't played your latest game, there's no need to ask them detailed feedback about it—skip to questions about why they didn't try it.

🔹 **Example 2**: If a podcast subscriber says they don't watch your video content, you can skip questions about visual aspects and focus on what they do listen.

### 3️⃣ Diving Deeper Based on Responses

Some responses deserve more follow-up than others. Skip logic allows you to probe further only when necessary.

🔹 **Example 1**: If a player rates your game's difficulty as "Too Hard," follow up with a question about which mechanics they found challenging. If they rate it as "Just Right", move on.

🔹 **Example 2**: If a viewer says they prefer shorter content, ask how long their ideal video is. If they say they like longer videos, move to a different question.

### 4️⃣ Handling "Other" Responses

When you include an "Other" option, it's a good idea to follow up and learn more about what they mean.

🔹 **Example**: If someone chooses "Other" when asked how they discovered you, follow up with an open-text question so they can tell you where they found you.
