# The Dawn of Convos 

Every era has its dominant framework. Once it takes hold, it becomes so natural that we can hardly imagine another way of doing things. For decades, forms has been how data has been collected. And surveys have been using forms to listen at scale.

But every framework eventually reaches its breaking point. And forms and surveys have reached theirs.

## The Problem with Forms and Surveys  

Forms and Surveys have allowed organizations to ask structured questions and collect structured answers from people far beyond their immediate reach. For businesses, governments, and researchers, they became the backbone of insight. Entire industries were built on them.  

Yet today, the words *form* and *survey* are almost synonymous with frustration:  

- long, boring, irrelevant  
- filled with technical glitches and outdated UIs  
- punishing participants with endless questions  
- terminating respondents minutes in without reward because they don't "qualify"  
- treating people less like humans and more like data points  

The result? Declining engagement. Poor data quality. A crisis of trust. We‚Äôve built a multi-billion-dollar industry on top of a tool that fewer and fewer people actually want to use.

## Why Incremental Evolution Isn‚Äôt Enough  

Yes, surveys have *‚Äúevolved‚Äù*: from paper to phone, to web, to mobile. Each new medium promised a fresh start. But the core experience never really changed. The rigidity, the impersonality, the disrespect for respondents‚Äô time‚Äîall of it carried forward.  

Now AI, and especially large language models (LLMs), offers a chance to **reinvent the very idea of what it means to listen at scale**.

Because when you really want to understand someone, you don't send them a survey. You engage in a conversation.

To keep calling this a ‚Äúsurvey‚Äù would be like calling the automobile a *‚Äúfaster horse.‚Äù*

## The Birth of Convos  

At **Subo**, we‚Äôve stopped trying to fix the survey. Instead, we‚Äôre building something new. We call it a **convo**.  

Why *convo*?  
- Because it‚Äôs short, fresh, and free from the baggage of ‚Äúsurvey.‚Äù  
- Because it feels like what it is: a conversation.  
- Because conversations are how humans naturally share, listen, and connect.  

Convos aren‚Äôt just a rebrand. They are guided by principles that surveys never had‚Äîand never could.

## The Principles of Convos  

- **Agents with voice.** Convos are hosted by agents with personality, tone, and presence.  
- **Two-way by design.** Agents don‚Äôt just ask‚Äîthey listen, respond, clarify, and even answer questions.  
- **Adaptive, not linear.** Scripts are guidelines, not shackles. A convo adapts based on context and energy.  
- **Memory across time.** Convos remember what people share, creating continuity and depth.  
- **Personalized.** A teenager and a retiree should never receive the same tone.  
- **Respectful of time.** Convos are short by default, with the ability to pause and resume.  
- **No terminations.** Every response matters. If someone gives their time, they deserve thanks and recognition.  
- **Curious, observant, human.** Convos notice fatigue, sense disinterest, and know when to probe deeper‚Äîor when to gracefully wrap up.  

This is not a patch. **This is a reset.**

## The Future of Listening  

For too long, surveys have asked people to bend to their rules. Convos flip that dynamic. They meet people where they are, with empathy, flexibility, and respect. They transform data collection from a tedious transaction into a meaningful exchange.  

This isn‚Äôt just about improving response rates or reducing drop-offs. It‚Äôs about restoring the **dignity of participation**. It‚Äôs about recognizing that the people behind the data are, first and foremost, *people*.  

The survey had its time. It helped us listen at scale when no better alternative existed. But today, clinging to surveys is clinging to a broken framework.  

The future belongs to convos.  

At **Subo**, we‚Äôre not simply asking questions.  
We‚Äôre starting conversations.

## üöÄ Join the movement  

Convos are the future of surveys.  
Let‚Äôs build a new way of listening‚Äîtogether.
