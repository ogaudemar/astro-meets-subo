# The Complete Guide to Anonymous Surveys in Discord

The most important feedback is often the hardest to collect. When members feel like their answers might be traced back to them, they self-censor. They tell you what they think you want to hear, not what they actually think.

This is especially true in Discord communities where members know each other, where the server owner is often a public figure, and where saying the wrong thing can mean losing access to a community they value.

Anonymous surveys change this dynamic entirely. When members trust that their responses can't be attributed to them, they tell the truth.

Subo offers three distinct anonymity modes, each designed for different trust levels and use cases. Here's a complete guide to using them effectively.

## Why Anonymity Matters in Discord

Before diving into the mechanics, it's worth understanding *why* anonymity is particularly important in Discord specifically:

**Small, tight-knit communities have accountability pressure.** In a server of 50 people, everyone knows everyone. Saying "the admin events have been underwhelming lately" in a survey that a mod can link back to you has real social consequences.

**Power dynamics exist.** Server owners, admins, and mods have real power in Discord communities (banning, muting, removing roles). Members may hesitate to give critical feedback about leadership when they're not protected.

**Identity is tied to roles.** In Discord, your username and avatar are everywhere. It's harder to "disappear" into an anonymous response the way you might on an external form.

**High-stakes decisions deserve honest input.** When you're making decisions about community direction, events, leadership, or paid tiers, you need real feedback — not polite non-answers.

## Subo's Three Anonymity Modes

### Mode 1: Identified (Default)

In this mode, responses are linked to the Discord user who submitted them. You can see exactly who said what.

**When to use it:**
- General engagement surveys where there's no sensitive content
- Onboarding surveys that need follow-up contact
- Feedback where you want to recognize contributors ("Thanks for the feedback, @username!")
- Research where knowing who said something helps you take action

**What respondents see:** No explicit anonymity guarantee. They know their identity is visible to admins.

### Mode 2: "More Anonymous" (Partial Anonymity)

In this mode, individual responses are hidden from admins — you can't see who said what — but some metadata may still be associated with responses (depending on your configuration). The respondent sees a notice that their individual responses won't be shown to admins, but the survey system still knows who participated.

**When to use it:**
- Sensitive feedback where you want to protect individual respondents but still need participation tracking
- Situations where you want to offer anonymity as a trust signal without full anonymization
- Cases where you need to confirm survey completion without reading individual responses (e.g., for role rewards)

**What respondents see:** A clear notice that their individual responses are private, though their participation may be tracked.

### Mode 3: Full Anonymous

In this mode, responses are completely severed from identity. You receive the data, but there is no way — technically — to determine who submitted any individual response.

**When to use it:**
- Sensitive community topics (leadership feedback, interpersonal issues, rule changes)
- Mental health or wellbeing pulse checks
- Feedback on server policies or moderation decisions
- Any situation where you genuinely want the most honest possible responses

**What respondents see:** A clear, prominent statement that their responses are fully anonymous and cannot be traced.

**Important note on role rewards:** In full anonymous mode, automatic role rewards for completion cannot be assigned (since the system doesn't know who to credit). If you need both full anonymity and role rewards, consider using partial mode or awarding rewards manually.

## When to Choose Each Mode

Use this simple decision framework:

**Is the topic sensitive or could feedback be socially risky for respondents?**
- Yes → Use Full Anonymous or More Anonymous
- No → Identified is fine

**Do you need to follow up with specific respondents?**
- Yes → Use Identified
- No → Any mode works

**Are you offering XP or role rewards for completion?**
- Yes, and full anonymity is important → Use More Anonymous (participation tracking without response tracking)
- Rewards aren't critical → Full Anonymous is available

**Is trust low (e.g., community has had past drama, mod conflicts, or members who've been unfairly treated)?**
- Yes → Full Anonymous, and communicate this prominently when you launch the survey

## Building Trust Around Anonymity

The mechanics of anonymity only work if your members *believe* the survey is actually anonymous. Here's how to establish that trust:

**Be explicit in your announcement.** When you share the survey, state clearly: "This survey is fully anonymous. I genuinely cannot see who submitted what. Say what you actually think." Don't just rely on the system's anonymity notice.

**Don't try to identify respondents indirectly.** If you run a full anonymous survey and then post: "Interesting that someone from the EU mentioned X" — you've just poisoned your own anonymity guarantee. Members will notice, and they'll self-censor on the next survey.

**Follow up on anonymous feedback genuinely.** If anonymous feedback reveals a problem, address it — without speculating about who raised it. The follow-through is what builds long-term trust in the survey system.

**Use anonymity consistently.** If you only pull out the anonymous survey mode when you expect bad news, members will notice the pattern. Run anonymous surveys as a regular practice, not just when you're bracing for criticism.

**Acknowledge that anonymity has limits.** If you're in a very small server (10–20 members), full anonymity still can't prevent someone from inferring authorship from writing style or context. Be honest about this with your community, and don't over-promise on topics where truly anonymous feedback would require extraordinary effort.

## Real-World Anonymous Survey Examples

### Moderator Performance Review

"How would you rate the moderation team's recent handling of [specific situation]?" — Full anonymous. Members who felt they were treated unfairly can say so without fear of retaliation.

### Community Direction Survey

"Should we expand into [new topic area] or stay focused on [current topic]?" — Partial or full anonymous. This prevents the most vocal members from dominating the results.

### Leadership Satisfaction Check

"How satisfied are you with the direction the server is taking?" with follow-up open-ended: "What would you change?" — Full anonymous. This is where you'll learn things you won't hear otherwise.

### Mental Health or Wellbeing Pulse

"How's everyone doing this month? (1-5 scale + optional comments)" — Full anonymous. Members struggling won't disclose this if they think it's logged to their account.

### Pricing / Monetization Feedback

"Would you pay for a premium tier? What would it need to include?" — Partial or full anonymous. Financial opinions are personal; people give more honest answers when they're not on the record.

## Anonymous Surveys and Data Integrity

One common concern with anonymous surveys is gaming — what if someone submits multiple responses? Subo handles this by default: even in anonymous mode, it prevents duplicate responses from the same user (based on Discord account). The *identity* of the respondent is not stored in the results, but the system still prevents duplicates at submission time.

This means you get the benefits of anonymity (honest responses, no social pressure) without the risk of a single person flooding your survey with repeated answers.

## Getting Started

Anonymous mode is available on all Subo plans. Simply toggle it when creating or configuring a survey. The default is Identified — you have to actively enable anonymity.
