# Scheduling Recurring Surveys: How to Take a Weekly Pulse of Your Community

The best community managers don't just collect feedback once — they collect it continuously. A community that was thriving six months ago might be struggling today. The server that felt chaotic last quarter might have found its rhythm now. You can't know unless you're asking regularly.

But "asking regularly" is hard when it means manually launching a new survey every week. You have other things to do.

Subo's scheduling and recurring survey features solve this. Set a survey up once, configure its schedule, and let it run automatically — every week, every month, or on whatever cadence makes sense for your community.

## What Scheduling Lets You Do

Subo's scheduling system (available on Premium and above) lets you:

- **Schedule a survey to launch at a specific date and time** — useful for surveys tied to events, announcements, or other milestones
- **Set an automatic close date/time** — the survey stops accepting responses without you having to manually close it
- **Configure recurring surveys** — surveys that automatically re-launch at set intervals (weekly, monthly, or custom)
- **Set a total respondent limit** — automatically close the survey when it reaches a certain number of responses

Combined, these features mean you can design a complete survey lifecycle — from auto-launch to auto-close — without touching it again.

## Use Cases for Scheduled Surveys

### Weekly Community Pulse

**The setup:** A 3–5 question survey that launches every Monday and closes on Friday. Questions cover: general vibe, activity satisfaction, notable events, and one open-ended "anything we missed?" question.

**Why it works:** You get a consistent dataset over time. Trend lines become visible. You can spot the week that vibe scores dropped (and cross-reference it with what happened that week — maybe a controversy, a server outage, or a popular member leaving).

**The alternative (without scheduling):** You'd have to manually launch this survey every single Monday, then manually close it every Friday. For a weekly cadence, that's 100+ manual actions per year.

### Monthly Satisfaction Survey

**The setup:** A more comprehensive 8–10 question survey that launches on the 1st of every month and closes on the 7th. Covers satisfaction with different aspects of the server: content, events, community culture, moderation, and future plans.

**Why it works:** Monthly gives you a macro view that weekly misses. It captures slower-moving trends and is less affected by individual week-to-week noise.

### Post-Event Surveys

**The setup:** Not recurring, but scheduled. You schedule the survey to launch immediately after a scheduled event (tournament, watch party, AMA, etc.) and close 48 hours later.

**Why it works:** Feedback while it's fresh. You don't have to remember to launch it in the middle of managing everything else that happens after an event.

### Quarterly Community Health Report

**The setup:** A comprehensive survey (15–20 questions) that launches four times a year. Covers demographics, engagement patterns, feature requests, satisfaction, and one or two research-style open-ended questions.

**Why it works:** Quarterly data is ideal for bigger decisions — restructuring the server, launching paid tiers, bringing on additional mods. You want enough data to make confident calls, not just a week's snapshot.

### New Member Onboarding Survey

**The setup:** Not recurring — but scheduled to launch automatically for new members after a set period (e.g., 7 days after they join). This is triggered by Subo targeting members who joined in the last week, launched on a weekly schedule.

**Why it works:** New member feedback is most valuable when they're still fresh. After 3 months, they've adapted to how things work and can't easily remember their first impressions.

## How to Set Up a Recurring Survey in Subo

### Step 1: Build your survey

Design your pulse survey with the questions you want to ask. For recurring surveys, keep questions consistent across cycles — this is what creates trend data. If you change the questions every week, you can't compare week 4 to week 1.

### Step 2: Configure scheduling

In the survey settings, set:
- **Start date and time** — when the first run should launch
- **Recurrence interval** — weekly, monthly, or a custom number of days
- **Auto-close settings** — close after N days, or after N respondents

### Step 3: Configure notifications (optional)

Set up notifications to a private channel when:
- The survey launches
- New responses come in
- The survey closes

This gives you visibility without requiring you to check manually.

### Step 4: Set up results sharing

For recurring pulse surveys, you may want to auto-post a summary of results to a community channel when the survey closes. This keeps the community in the loop and shows members that their feedback is being collected and seen.

### Step 5: Monitor and adjust

After a few cycles, review the data. Are completion rates consistent? Are certain questions generating confusion? Are there patterns emerging? You can adjust the survey (for the next cycle) without disrupting ongoing data collection.

## Tips for Recurring Survey Design

**Keep recurring surveys short.** 3–7 questions is ideal. Long surveys have lower completion rates, and when people are filling out the same survey every week, fatigue is real. Respect their time.

**Use consistent question wording across cycles.** If you ask "How satisfied are you with the server this week?" in week 1 and "Overall, how happy are you with this community?" in week 2, your data isn't comparable. Pick your wording and stick with it.

**Include at least one open-ended question.** Quantitative scores tell you *how much* things have changed. Open-ended questions tell you *why*. Even one text field — "Anything else you'd like to share?" — can surface issues that your closed-ended questions missed.

**Set realistic completion expectations.** Not every member will complete every cycle. A 20–30% completion rate on an opt-in recurring survey is healthy. Focus on trends and patterns, not absolute numbers.

**Vary your announcement approach.** If you announce the weekly pulse in the same way every week ("Reminder: pulse survey is live!"), it becomes noise. Rotate your framing: reference a specific question this week, call out a trend you noticed from last week's results, or add a light competitive element ("Last week 43 people responded — let's beat that!").

## Reading the Trend Data

The real power of recurring surveys isn't any single data point — it's the trend line across cycles. Here's what to look for:

**Sustained drops in satisfaction scores** → investigate what changed around that time
**Sudden spikes in a specific question** → something specific triggered a reaction
**Declining completion rates** → survey fatigue or declining engagement; consider shortening or refreshing
**Consistent low scores on one dimension** → a structural issue that one-off surveys missed
**Growing response rates** → engagement is building; the community values being heard

The Subo web admin lets you compare results across survey runs, making this trend analysis straightforward.

## Getting Started

Scheduling and recurring surveys are available on Subo **Premium** ($2.99/month) and above. Free tier users can manually launch surveys but can't set automated schedules.
