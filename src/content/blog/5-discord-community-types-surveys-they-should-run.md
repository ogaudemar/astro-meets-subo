# 5 Discord Community Types and the Surveys They Should Be Running

Discord hosts an incredible variety of communities. A gaming guild running nightly raids has completely different feedback needs than a creator server connecting fans with content, or a DAO making governance decisions. Yet most survey tools treat all communities identically.

Here's a breakdown of 5 common Discord community archetypes, what they're typically trying to learn from their members, and exactly what surveys they should be running — plus sample questions to get you started.

---

## 1. Gaming Guilds and Competitive Teams

### What's at stake

Gaming communities thrive on coordination, trust, and shared goals. A raid that fails because of poor composition choices, or a team that fractures because scheduling is impossible — these are preventable problems that feedback can surface.

### Surveys to run

**Pre-Season / Expansion Survey**
When a major game update drops, poll your members on their plans: What roles/classes are they maining? What content do they want to focus on? What's their availability? This lets leadership make roster and scheduling decisions based on real data.

*Sample questions:*
- "Which role are you planning to main this season?" (single choice)
- "How many hours per week do you expect to play?" (numeric)
- "What's your primary goal this season?" (multiple choice: ranked play, casual, story content, end-game raiding)

**Post-Raid Debrief Survey**
Collect structured feedback after major events while impressions are fresh.

*Sample questions:*
- "Rate tonight's raid from 1–5" (numeric)
- "What went well?" (open text)
- "What should we do differently?" (open text)
- "Are you satisfied with your role assignment?" (yes/no)

**Schedule Optimization Poll**
The eternal scheduling problem. Instead of guessing, ask.

*Sample questions:*
- "Which days work best for raid nights?" (multiple choice — days of week)
- "Preferred start time?" (multiple choice — time ranges)
- "How much notice do you need to be available?" (single choice)

**Roster / Leadership Elections**
When it's time to elect officers, captains, or class leads, run it as a proper survey rather than a Discord poll anyone can see.

## 2. Creator Communities (YouTubers, Streamers, Podcasters)

### What's at stake

Creators live and die by audience engagement and content-market fit. Their Discord is their most engaged fan base — the people who care most. But creators often have a visibility problem: they can see view counts and subscriber numbers, but not *why* people watch, what they want more of, or how they actually feel about the community.

### Surveys to run

**Content Preference Survey**
What's your audience actually watching, and what do they want to see next?

*Sample questions:*
- "Which type of content do you enjoy most?" (multiple choice: tutorials, vlogs, gaming, reviews, IRL)
- "How often do you want new uploads?" (single choice)
- "Is there a topic you'd like to see covered that we haven't done yet?" (open text)
- "What's the main reason you joined this server?" (single choice)

**Community Vibe Check**
A quick monthly pulse on how the community is feeling.

*Sample questions:*
- "How would you rate the community vibe this month? (1–5)" (numeric)
- "Have you made any friends in this server?" (yes/no)
- "Is there anything that's been bothering you about the community lately?" (optional open text, anonymous)

**Event Voting Survey**
Contests, giveaways, watch parties, charity streams — let the community co-create these.

*Sample questions:*
- "Which of these community events sounds most interesting?" (multiple choice)
- "What prize would make you most likely to enter a giveaway?" (multiple choice + open text)

**Fan Profile Survey**
Understand who your community actually is — demographic and interest data that most creators never have.

*Sample questions:*
- "How old are you?" (numeric or range)
- "Where did you first find our content?" (single choice)
- "How long have you been watching/listening?" (single choice)
- "What other creators do you follow?" (open text)

## 3. DAOs and Web3 Communities

### What's at stake

Decentralized communities have a unique challenge: governance decisions are often voted on-chain, but the *discussion* and *sentiment* that precedes a vote happens in Discord. Informal surveys can reveal community sentiment before formal votes are held, surface concerns that aren't captured in token-weighted votes, and ensure that less vocal token holders still have a way to express preferences.

### Surveys to run

**Pre-Vote Sentiment Survey**
Before a formal governance vote, run an informal survey to gauge sentiment and surface concerns.

*Sample questions:*
- "How do you feel about [Proposal X]?" (single choice: strongly support, support, neutral, oppose, strongly oppose)
- "What concerns do you have about this proposal?" (open text, anonymous)
- "Are there modifications that would make you more likely to support it?" (open text)

**Community Health Survey**
Measure how members feel about the DAO's direction, not just specific proposals.

*Sample questions:*
- "How aligned do you feel with the DAO's current direction? (1–5)" (numeric)
- "Which area needs the most improvement?" (multiple choice: communication, governance process, treasury management, community culture, technical development)
- "How likely are you to remain active in this DAO over the next 6 months? (1–5)" (numeric)

**New Member Integration Survey**
DAOs often have poor onboarding. Find out where new members are getting confused.

*Sample questions:*
- "How would you rate your onboarding experience? (1–5)" (numeric)
- "What was the most confusing part of joining?" (open text)
- "Did you feel welcomed by the community?" (yes/no)
- "What would have made your first week better?" (open text)

**NFT / Token Holder Feedback**
Specific to token-gated or NFT-based communities.

*Sample questions:*
- "What utilities would increase the value of holding [token/NFT]?" (multiple choice + open text)
- "How do you typically use your membership benefits?" (multiple choice)
- "What would make you buy more?" (open text)

## 4. Brand and Business Communities

### What's at stake

Brands using Discord as a community hub (instead of or alongside traditional social media) need to understand customer satisfaction, product feedback, and community health — all in one place. The feedback here often has direct business value: product roadmap input, support need identification, and customer loyalty signals.

### Surveys to run

**Product Feedback Survey**
Your most engaged customers are in your Discord. Ask them.

*Sample questions:*
- "Which feature do you use most?" (single choice)
- "What's the biggest pain point with [product] right now?" (open text)
- "If you could add one feature to [product], what would it be?" (open text)
- "How likely are you to recommend [product] to a friend? (1–10)" (numeric — Net Promoter Score)

**Customer Satisfaction Survey**
A regular CSAT check via Discord.

*Sample questions:*
- "How satisfied are you with [product/service] this month? (1–5)" (numeric)
- "How satisfied are you with our customer support? (1–5)" (numeric)
- "What's working well?" (open text)
- "What's frustrating you?" (open text, anonymous)

**Beta Tester Survey**
Before launching new features to the broader user base, test with your Discord community.

*Sample questions:*
- "How easy was [new feature] to use? (1–5)" (numeric)
- "Did it work as you expected?" (yes/no)
- "What would you change about it?" (open text)
- "Would you use this feature regularly?" (yes/no)

**Community Member Profile**
Understand who's actually in your Discord — they may be different from your typical customer.

*Sample questions:*
- "How long have you been a [product] customer?" (single choice)
- "How did you find our Discord server?" (single choice)
- "Do you primarily use our product for work or personal use?" (single choice)

## 5. Educational and Study Communities

### What's at stake

Educational Discord servers — study groups, tutoring communities, online course cohorts, skill-building groups — need to measure comprehension, satisfaction with instruction, and the health of the learning community itself. The feedback loop between instructors and learners is what separates great educational experiences from mediocre ones.

### Surveys to run

**Comprehension Check Survey**
After a lesson, lecture, or workshop session.

*Sample questions:*
- "How well did you understand today's material? (1–5)" (numeric)
- "What concept was most unclear?" (open text)
- "Do you feel ready to apply what you learned?" (yes/no)
- "What would help you understand this better?" (open text)

**Curriculum Feedback Survey**
Regular check-in on whether the overall program is meeting learner needs.

*Sample questions:*
- "How would you rate the curriculum so far? (1–5)" (numeric)
- "Are topics covered at the right pace?" (single choice: too fast, right pace, too slow)
- "Which topic do you want to spend more time on?" (single choice from list)
- "What topics are missing that you expected to cover?" (open text)

**Study Group Matching Survey**
Help learners find compatible study partners.

*Sample questions:*
- "What's your availability for study sessions?" (multiple choice — time slots)
- "What's your current knowledge level?" (single choice)
- "What learning style works best for you?" (multiple choice)
- "Are you looking for a study partner or a study group?" (single choice)

**Community Culture Survey**
Healthy learning requires psychological safety.

*Sample questions:*
- "Do you feel comfortable asking questions in this community? (1–5)" (numeric)
- "Have you experienced anything in this server that made you uncomfortable?" (yes/no; if yes, optional open text — anonymous)
- "How welcoming is this community to beginners? (1–5)" (numeric)

## Getting Started

Regardless of which community type you run, the pattern is the same:

1. **Identify your most important decision** — what do you most need to understand about your community right now?
2. **Choose the right survey format** — conversational convo or quick poll
3. **Pick the right anonymity level** — sensitive topics need anonymous mode
4. **Set up incentives** — XP points and role rewards drive completion
5. **Schedule it** — set a recurrence so you collect trend data, not just one-off snapshots
